  "description": "The typing module is a Node.js module that adds a typing effect to a given text string. It simulates the effect of a user typing out a message on the console by printing out each character of the message one by one with a specified delay between each character. The module allows you to customize the delay between each character and also allows you to specify the color of the text being printed. The typing module can be used in any Node.js application to add a dynamic and interactive touch to your console output, and can be particularly useful for creating CLI tools or interactive command-line interfaces.",
